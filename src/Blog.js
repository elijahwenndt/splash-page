                <h4>Bootcamp and Final Demo Day Retro</h4>
                <li>Well I made it. After an insane schedule and many sleepless nights I have finally crossed the finish line. Before I began this whole process I couldn't wait to 'learn how to code' and become a developer. It is only now after all this work do I realize that the learning process has only just begun, and I could not be more excited. I have worked a ton of difficult jobs in the past. Being apart of the labor industry is physically challenging, but not stimulating in the ways that my younger self had hoped. Now I get to be a lifelong student. Constantly growing, developing, and building projects while learning along the way. I have finally found a path in life that fulfills me mentally and cannot wait to continue this journey. I feel an overwhelming sense of pride in my current accomplishments, but am obviously very nervous about the future. With an ongoing job hunt process I can't help but to be nervous. However, with the skills that I have learned during this bootcamp I know that I will overcome them and eventually land at a great company. Here's to the future!</li>

                <h4>What was your experience like overall in the Bootcamp?</h4>
                <li>In retrospect, my experience was overwhelmingly positive. Awesome Inc's web development bootcamp was one of the most difficult tasks I have ever accomplished. Many 60+ hour weeks and some very late nights had me questioning my decision to change my career path so drastically. However, while reflecting on my experience, even with the difficulty, I am happy with my decision. I have turned a corner in my life that will ultimately lead me down the path that I want to be in. </li>
                <h4>Take a look back at your blog posts over the last 16 weeks. Where do you see yourself growing the most? What is one thing that pops out as you being misinformed or that you think is funny compared to what you know now?</h4>
                <li>Two weeks stick out. The beginning of the React week I was definitely floundering. While eventually it did click, during the learning process I found myself nearly completely lost. After throwing myself at it and leaning on my instructors it has become my greatest strength currently. Now I do find it a little humorous how worried I was about it. The second period of immense growth was doing the final project. I began the first week of coding with covid. I lost three full days to sickness that my peers had spent developing their ideas into a working project. I was behind and had to catch up. With some help from some of my peers and some long days I was able to catch up and deliver my MVP plus a few extra features. Connecting everything that we had learned up to that point together was a heavy lift. I learned what it meant to work on a full-stack project.</li>
                <h4>Will you continue this blog throughout the rest of post-work? How about for the rest of the year? How about the rest of your life? Will you keep posting? Will you need to be stopped?</h4>
                <li>I will definitely continue to blog throughout my career. My final project was a blogging app! Blogging is something that can help you get your ideas and aspirations down in order to cement them. This allows you to grow and reflect while you move through different aspects of life. I believe it is an important process in more than just the development space.</li>

                <h4>After making it through the tech stack, where do you think your current gaps are?</h4>
                <li>My gaps definitely exist more on the backend than the frontend. While i can accomplish some simple tasks and create a database using Django and DRF I need some practice with the in depth backend functionalities that you can accomplish using those tools. </li>
                <h4>Without considering the complexity, what is a custom hook you would write to help you in any aspect of web development (or something else...)</h4>
                <li>To start things off, I would like to make some custom git commands that allow me to commit faster than I currently can.</li>
                <h4>What is your opinion on documentation? (MVP, Stories, Points, Markdown, Personas, Readme, Pseudocode, etc.)</h4>
                <li>I believe that the MVP is the most important document that you can create. It is the all encompassing document that outlines the entire project and lays the ground work for what needs to be accomplished. Both on the client side and the development side it can set a specific goals that will provide a benchmark for the work to come. Pseudocoding is also an extremely important part of the development process. Laying out the features in a plain english format can be incredibly helpful, especially when you don't know exactly how to accomplish the task at hand. </li>

                <h4>Describe Agile Development or a specific ceremony (stand up, retro, sprints, etc.)</h4>
                <li>I would like to focus on the stand up. I believe that the daily stand up is one of the most important processes that exists in a team based development environment. The stand up process allows the whole team to be aware of their coworkers progress on the current sprint, what challenges they are currently facing, and what is outright blocking them from continuing forward. Without stand up there would be a lot less inter-connectivity between a development team, even with a shared KanBan board or backlog.</li>
                <h4>Convince someone who does not use frameworks why using a framework is beneficial. (Bootstrap, React, Django, or DRF)</h4>
                <li>I believe that compared to vanilla javascript, Reactjs is one of the most powerful libraries out today that allows a user to make small, reusable bits of code that can be utilized over and over again. It keeps the development space clean and allows a developer to quickly change a something like a navbar in only a single location, rather than several. Especially with the newest version of React, it is a easy to use tool that should be in every web developers tool belt.</li>

                <h4>What are you struggling with the most in the Tech Stack so far and why?</h4>
                <li>I am definitely struggling more with the backend side of things. Django can be a difficult thing to handle and without the simplicity of the MDN documentation it can be hard to find the correct solutions that i am looking for when attempting to search through backend focused documentation.</li>
                <h4>What companies or people (local or not) would you like to hear talk during a Bootcamp lunch and learn?</h4>
                <li>I would definitely like to hear from Belcan. As a local aerospace technology company they would have a unique perspective on development and engineering. Another company would be Oracle. They have a local branch here in lexington and it would be cool to hear from a company that is of that size and works with cloud computing.</li>
                <h4>After having built your first full-stack application, what things in your repertoire are a sticking point for you? Were you able to reconnect your React Restaurant to your Backend Bistro code? If so, what was that like, and if not, what hurdles did you need to jump? </h4>
                <li>I need to work more with more with django and DRF. While there is a level of comfort that i am reaching with the backend i still have a long way to go. I was able to successfully hook up my frontend to my backend. It is a great feeling knowing that i have a full stack website under my belt. Utilizing DRF I found it pretty intuitive to accomplish this. I now have a better understanding of the power of the admin tools and the simplicity it can be to accomplish tasks using them.</li>

                <h4>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?</h4>
                <li>Javascript and python are cut from the same cloth. Often times its easy to misconstrue them as extremely similar. They both have all of the same ingredients that make up a programming language. They both have arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions. However the execution and use cases for these two languages are fairly different. Even though it is beginning to change, javascript still remains as a majority front-end language, while python exists more behind the scenes. one is used for manipulating data to be displayed or dynamically rendering a web page, the other often does more of the heavy lifting. </li>
                <h4>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?</h4>
                <li>I do not believe i would have benefited personally. While python is an excellent language to learn syntax because of its 'plain english' wording, being able to actually see 'pixels on the page' so to speak is helpful to show that our work ends with a more concrete product. Javascript is a core concept that is necessary to produce anything on the web.</li>
                <h4>Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future? </h4>
                <li>While I am not a large user of social media, the database structure for many simple social media sites i seem to have a grasp on. In my future projects post bootcamp i could definitely see myself building a reddit clone or something similar just for fun. </li>

                <h4>Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?</h4>
                <li>So far the biggest hurdle for myself has been tackling the new syntax and structure of languages/frameworks/libraries we are using. Specifically the two most difficult weeks has been the first week learning react, and this week working through Evercraft. The biggest thing to power through will be handling the intricacies and syntax of python logic. While im unsure what this next week's project will be, adding on to what we have already learned is always a challenge, but i am excited to take the next step.</li>
                <h4>Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?</h4>
                <li>The first idea (and now the most likely idea i will run with) is a personal mental health journaling website. A user will pick an emoji on how they are feeling for that day, and then make a comment on why they were feeling that way on a specific day. a user will log in and have a record of how they were feeling on different days and be able to get there thoughts about why they felt that way. Hopefully this will aid the user in there personal mental health journey. My second idea would be cloning something like reddit or another simple social media site. My last idea is a take-a-number ticketing queue system. a business would allow users to connect and enter a queue. when the users turn comes up they will get a notification telling them it is their turn.</li>
                <h4>What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript?</h4>
                <li>While i am still struggling with the syntax and execution of python, i was surprised how simple the wording of the language is. When googling for a solution it often makes it easier to find answers to issues because of python's 'plain english' syntax. </li>

                <h4>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</h4>
                <li>So far i have learned how to utilize the CLI for Git at a basic level. I am able to do a decent amount of functions strictly through the CLI and dont have to switch to github in order to do most basic functions. While I am not afraid to use CLI's (nor do i think they are scary) i still have a lot to learn about them. I need to learn more about the CLI for Git as well as other tasks it can do</li>
                <h4>If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?</h4>
                <li>At this point i am unsure. maybe have a CLI that can paste in certain large chunks of reusable code with a single command. As of right now i believe that a CLI someone else has built would have much more functionality than i could personally conceive.</li>
                <h4>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</h4>
                <li>Frameworks are very powerful, especially concerning javascript. Pretty much any dynamically generated website would take much longer to make without react. Managing state and rendering chunks of code is much easier with Reacts innate re-useability.</li>

                <h4>Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</h4>
                <li>At the beginning of this week, I had a very difficult time transitioning from plain js into React. The differences in languages were minor, but the functionalities and use-cases of a completely new javascript library can be confusing to someone who is so new to Javascript. However, as the week progressed (thursday afternoon to be precise) it finally clicked. Now React makes sense. While i still wouldn't call it easy to use, the compartmentalization aspect of the modules allow a programmer to break down the functionalities into small pieces, which makes individual component functionalities easier to solve.  </li>
                <h4>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h4>
                <li>Flutter for its ability to triple launch on the web, android, and iOS. React native in the same vein as that. Material UI because it is similar to bootstrap in its use but also is a library that has pretty widespread use throughout the industry. Another small one is Kotlin. I know a lot of the industry is moving away from java, but it still the 3rd most used language in the development space, and kotlin makes java easier.</li>
                <h4>Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.</h4>
                <li>I would consider picking up Electron. While it uses a lot of memory and is pretty inefficient, it can make developing Desktop apps using </li>

                <h4 class ="text-center">The beginnings of a technical article(How to refactor code from the perspective of a beginner)</h4>
                <p>Every programmer knows how to code. From someone in the middle of bootcamp, to the lowest jr developer, to the highest sr dev on the team. Good code is what fuels the industry. But how does one write good code? Often times the code a beginner writes is functional, but not production level. In this article i will attempt to explain how to refactor your code from the perspective of someone who is nearly a complete beginner.</p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Functional code is king</h5>
                <p>Before even beginning to speak about refactoring, we need to get one thing straight. Functional code is king. If there is a specific way that you <em>KNOW</em> how to solve a problem brought up in your project, then use that solution first. When you are taking part of a bootcamp, you are typically on a tight schedule. Sometimes you just need to get the logic or design working within a time crunch. In this case, it is better to have working code than no code. An instructor can guide you into how to refactor your code into a better, more succinct solution. As a student in a bootcamp especially, you will be on tight deadline to get a presentable project. Having a working project when it is time to present is much more important. After your personal demo day, thats when the refactoring can begin. </p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Good, Better, Best</h5>
                <p>Most people when refactoring or looking at code in general, use the Good, Better, and Best paradigm. This basically means there are three levels of solutions to your code. Good, which means the solution you made works, but is not typically dry code. I give a direct example of a good solution to a problem below. Better, which is a solution that solves the same problem, but with less WET code. The answer is more succinct and runs better during its operation. Then Best, this is full blown production level code. As a bootcamper you dont need to worry about finding the best solution, you may not even understand why a Best solution works. When you are first learning its just fine to take a good solution, and make it better. </p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Begin Small</h5>
                <p>When beginning to refactor, you need to think small. often times there is obvious WET code within your project that you already know how to fix, just ran out of time before the deadline hit. Starting with something that you know how to fix is the best possible starting point you can have. I will give a simple example from my own code that was an easy fix, i just couldnt refactor it before the deadline. Using good, better, and best practices as a framework, this refactor is probably in the better catagory. While it still isnt perfect, it is better than the original code i produced.</p>
                <p>This was from a project where we built Tic-Tac-Toe. when setting up the eventListeners for the individual divs, I just threw them out in the open in order to set up all the 9 seperate divs with 'click' event listeners</p>
                <pre><code>
document.getElementById('0').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('1').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('2').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('3').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('4').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('5').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('6').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('7').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('8').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
                </code></pre>
                <p>I used this method again when players wanted to reset the game (as well as some other examples of WET code that have also been refactored</p>
                <pre><code>
{"function resetButton () { " }
    gameState = [
        '', '', '',
        '', '', '',
        '','','']

    playerTurn = 0
    playerLetter = 'X'
    turnCount = 0
    document.getElementById('0').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('1').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('2').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('3').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('4').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('5').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('6').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('7').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('8').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById("target").innerHTML='X starts first'
    document.getElementById('0').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('1').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('2').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('3').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('4').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('5').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('6').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('7').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('8').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
{"}"}
                </code></pre>
                <p>First of all, this code does work. In the timeframe we had to complete this project, I <em>KNEW</em> that this solution would work. I understood loops and how they function, but i wanted to have a working product that I could get that i knew would not produce any bugs. This would more than likely be in the good catagory. Its not very pretty code, but it did what it needed to while i was testing.</p>
                <p>Next is how I changed it up. Once again, I already knew how to rewrite this block using loops and functions, so refactoring wasnt very time consuming, and it was the first objective I tackled.</p>
                <pre><code>
{"function addListeners () { "}
    {"for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) { "}
        document.getElementById(i).addEventListener('click', playerMove)
   {" } "}
{"}"}
addListeners();

{"function removeListners () { "}
    {"for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) { "}
        document.getElementById(i).removeEventListener('click', playerMove)
   {"}"}
{"}"}

{"function makeBlank () { "}
    {"for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {"}
    document.getElementById(i).innerHTML = ''
   {"}"} 
{"}"}
                </code></pre>
                <p>So i took the code I wrote earlier, and changed it into a more brief solution. The code is significantly dryer than it was before. I repeat myself less, while still outputting the same result. I took my initial solution, and made it <em>better</em>. Still may not be best, but I was able to take criticism given to me during our demonstrations, and utilize it to write better code. The culmination of this being that i can call these functions wherever i want, and they will accomplish the same task without having to repeat the same 9 lines of code over again. However, its good to note that these solutions both accomplish the same result. Below I will show how i take these and utilize them throughout the project.</p>
                <pre><code>
    //uses the remove listeners to clear the board of event listeners so it becomes unclickable after a win
    {"if (winnerCheck==true) {"}
        document.getElementById("target").innerHTML=playerLetter + ': WINS!'
        removeListners();

    {"}"}
    _____________________________________________________________

    //Uses the makeBlank and addListeners functions to clear the board of content and re-add any listeners that were removed throughout the game.
    {"function resetButton () {"}
        gameState = [
            '', '', '',
            '', '', '',
            '','','']
        playerTurn = 0
        playerLetter = 'X'
        turnCount = 0
        makeBlank();
        document.getElementById("target").innerHTML='X starts first'
        addListeners();
    {"}"}
                </code></pre>
                <h5 class="text-center">In conclusion</h5>
                <p>This is how i was able to refactor some of my own code, simply. Once again, I did not try to immediately jump to the best solution. I took working, functioning code, and changed it into something better. Hopefully after looking through some of my own examples of projects from my time in bootcamp, you will also be able to begin to refactor you own code. Dont let complex solutions scare you if you are a total beginner, just dive in and get started on what you think you can accomplish. </p>

                <h4>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</h4>
                <li>This week i felt i have taken a huge jump in my knowledge. without going into to many specifics i found that a combination of proper pseudocode and incremental coding helps my development progress. being able to work out the logic of a small section of my projects then code that small portion eases the anxiety of looking at the project as a whole</li>
                <h4>What does it mean to develop good code?</h4>
                <li>It can mean a few things. however it mostly boils down to three main points. Your code needs to be readable/understandable. Your code needs to have simplicity. Your code needs to accomplish what it is intended to accomplish.
                </li>
                <h4>What does it mean to be a good developer?</h4>
                <li>This is also a question with a lot of intricate answers. It also goes hand-in-hand with the question above. a good developer needs to be able to write code that others can utilize. a good developer needs to be able to work in a team environment. a good developer needs to keep the end user in mind</li>
                <h4>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h4>
                <li>Myself personally? getting started. When looking at the entire scope of the project i can often get lost in what needs to be accomplished. by utilizing techniques i have mentioned above (proper pseudocode and incremental coding), i am learning to overcome the fear of getting started. once i am neck deep in the project i tend to enjoy myself. i love solving problems and working out logic</li>

                <h4>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h4>
                <li>There are two things that have held me back this week. The first is my lack of knowledge of proper syntax. I can work out problems logically but eventually I come to a point where I dont know how to write the code itself. With so many ways to solve the same problem I can end up lost in what I actually need to write out. The second issue is my lack of pseudocoding. While many students came together and work problems out on the white board, I didnt transfer that onto a document or piece of paper to refer back to later when our initial solutions did not work out.</li>
                <h4>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?</h4>
                <li>I have been struggling with the design aspects. I would like to delve deeper into bootstrap so I can solve issues that arise when attempting to take my design and reproduce it on the page.</li>
                <h4>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>Significantly better so far. While I still struggle with getting all the required materials done, while in-person i just feel that my retention and skills are increasing exponentially. During remote I felt that while I could complete the assignments given, my understanding of the base material lacked.</li>
                <h4>What is your “Why”?</h4>
                <li>I have mostly worked labor and labor management positions throughout my life. I have found success in these industries, but would rather not be doing labor as I grow older. throughout my experience i had never experienced injury. on january 18th 2022 a pallet was dropped onto my hand, breaking my finger. This was the first time i had been injured in 10 years. after this injury, and with the convencing of another coworker, i came to the realization that i need to switch careers if i am going to be healthy and successful.</li>

                <h4>What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</h4>
                <li>a combination of the help channel in slack, the instructors being available to answer questions, and the structure of the assignments given out through google with accompanying slides to assist in understanding.</li>
                <h4>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>i do not work well by myself. in a purely online learning environment, i struggle with motivation and how to get started with an assignment. working online negatively effects my understanding and accomplishments of tasks assigned. the tools and information provided to us was significant, but i am an in person learner. i need hands on, in-person instruction to feel confident in the assignments and learning materials that are given</li>
                <h4>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>using a combination of google, the help channel, and collaboration between students has helped me overcome the challenges i have faced during onboarding. specifically being able to collaborate with other students has increased my confidence and understanding of the concepts and materials given so far.</li>

                <h4>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h4>
                <li>I believe the best way to answer this is using the house example. HTML is like the structure of the house. It gives the structure and definitions for the rest of the house to function. The CSS is like the design and paint. While not necessary to a websites function, it can make it usuable for an average user and keep the page contents organized. Javascript is like the electricity and plumbing. While everything else is useful and necessary the javascript is what makes the page run.</li>
                <h4>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h4>
                <li>So far nothing much. I currently have an image posted but i will update the blog as we progress!</li>
                <h4>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</h4>
                <li>pseudocoding is a powerful tool that can help you break down a complicated problem without having to directly have an answer in the language you are using. It is a great and necessary first step when working on a coding project.</li>

                <h4>What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</h4>
                <li>I wish i had more speed and consistancy while coding. My long term goal is to look into and learn about webscraping</li>
                <h4>What are you struggling with?</h4>
                <li>keeping a more consistant schedule and learning the correct syntax for the languages we have worked with so far</li>
                <h4>How do you solve a problem?</h4>
                <li>i typically solve a problem by research and writing out the problem on paper or a white board. i enjoy delving into a topic until i can personally understand the problem at hand</li>
                <h4>What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</h4>
                <li>a combination of google and youtube during my research! i also have no trouble asking for help when needed!</li>

                <li>the first week was generally as expected. navigating github can be a little time consuming</li>
                <h4>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h4>
                <li>I am excited to get into javascript and less html and css. Specifically i am excited to begin learning React later on</li>
                <h4>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h4>
                <li>I love the outdoors, camping is one of my favorite activities. im interested in developing tools related to outdoor activities and outdoor gear pricing structures</li>
